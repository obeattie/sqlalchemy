- orm
    - the 'expire' option on query.update() has been renamed to 'fetch', thus matching
      that of query.delete()
    - query.update() and query.delete() both default to 'evaluate' for the synchronize 
      strategy.
    - the 'synchronize' strategy for update() and delete() raises an error on failure.  
      There is no implicit fallback onto "fetch".   Failure of evaluation is based
      on the structure of criteria, so success/failure is deterministic based on 
      code structure.
