# a table to store companies
companies = Table('companies', db, 
   Column('company_id', Integer, primary_key=True),
   Column('name', String(50))).create()

# we will define an inheritance relationship between the table "people" and "engineers",
# and a second inheritance relationship between the table "people" and "managers"
people = Table('people', db,

# next we assign Person mappers.  Since these are the first mappers we are
# creating for these classes, they automatically become the "primary mappers", which
# define the dependency relationships between the classes, so we do a straight
# inheritance setup, i.e. no modifications to how objects are loaded or anything like that.

assign_mapper(Engineer, engineers, inherits=Person.mapper)
assign_mapper(Manager, managers, inherits=Person.mapper)

# next, we define a query that is going to load Managers and Engineers in one shot.
# we will use a UNION ALL with an extra hardcoded column to indicate the type of object.
# this can also be done via several LEFT OUTER JOINS but a UNION is more appropriate
# since they are distinct result sets.
# The select() statement is also given an alias 'pjoin', since the mapper requires
# that all Selectables have a name.  
#
# TECHNIQUE - when you want to load a certain set of objects from a in one query, all the
# columns in the Selectable must have unique names.  Dont worry about mappers at this point,
# just worry about making a query where if you were to view the results, you could tell everything
# you need to know from each row how to construct an object instance from it.  this is the
# essence of "resultset-based-mapping", which is the core ideology of SQLAlchemy.

# lets print out what this Selectable looks like.  The mapper is going to take the selectable and
# Select off of it, with the flag "use_labels" which indicates to prefix column names with the table
# name.  So here is what our mapper will see:
print "Person selectable:", str(person_join.select(use_labels=True)), "\n"

people_mapper = mapper(Person, person_join, extension=ext)

# create a mapper for Company.  the 'employees' relationship points to 
# our new people_mapper. 
#
# the dependency relationships which take effect on commit (i.e. the order of 
# inserts/deletes) will be established against the Person class's primary 
# mapper, and when the Engineer and 
# Manager objects are found in the 'employees' list, the primary mappers
# for those subclasses will register 
# themselves as dependent on the Person mapper's save operations.
# (translation: it'll work)
# TODO: get the eager loading to work (the compound select alias doesnt like being aliased itself)
