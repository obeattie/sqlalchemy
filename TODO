mapper can take a row-processing/object instantiating function, without expensive construction

lazy/eager loaders added to mapper via a list instaed of dictionary (do we ?)

this will add a lot to SmartProperty since it needs to support a list of properties that all trigger
one lazy loader

simple table inheritance

Oracle module

Postgres module

MySQL module

INSERT from a SELECT

extension types, like pickle type, user-defined types

type bind param handling and result row handling
