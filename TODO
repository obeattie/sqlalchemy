TODO:


table reflection, i.e. create tables with autoload = True

mapper can take a row-processing/object instantiating function, without expensive construction

lazy/eager loaders added to mapper via a list instaed of dictionary

clean up select test suite

horizontal lazy/eager loaders for one object across tables - add it to existing lazy/eager loader
this will add a lot to SmartProperty since it needs to support a list of properties that all trigger
one lazy loader

unit of work ?
