TODO:


table reflection, i.e. create tables with autoload = True

sequences/autoincrement support

mapper can take a row-processing/object instantiating function, without expensive construction

lazy/eager loaders added to mapper via a list instaed of dictionary

clean up select test suite

horizontal lazy/eager loaders for one object across tables - add it to existing lazy/eager loader
this will add a lot to SmartProperty since it needs to support a list of properties that all trigger
one lazy loader

saving !

unit of work ?

identity map - more like fowlers



Oracle module

Postgres module

MySQL module
