We've moved the source repository to Mercurial !   Now
everyone can clone and develop at will.   

To get at the latest tip, go to:

hg clone http://hg.sqlalchemy.org/sqlalchemy

The above URL has a nice source browser too, or
you can use trac as always.

The current plan is that the SVN source tree here 
will be switched off at some point.  Mercurial
commits aren't being mirrored here.
