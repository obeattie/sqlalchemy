Documentation exists in its original format as Markdown files in the ./content directory.

To generate documentation:

	python genhtml.py

This generates the Markdown files into Myghty templates as an interim step and then into HTML.  It also
creates two pickled datafiles corresponding to the table of contents and all the generated docstrings
for the SQLAlchemy sourcecode.
