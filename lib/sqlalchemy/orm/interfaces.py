    The ``LoaderStrategy`` interacts with the querying process in three

    * it controls the configuration of the ``InstrumentedAttribute``
      placed on a class to handle the behavior of the attribute.  this
      may involve setting up class-level callable functions to fire
      off a select operation when the attribute is first accessed
      (i.e. a lazy load)

    * it processes the ``QueryContext`` at statement construction time,
      where it can modify the SQL statement that is being produced.
      simple column attributes may add their represented column to the
      list of selected columns, *eager loading* properties may add
      ``LEFT OUTER JOIN`` clauses to the statement.

    * it processes the ``SelectionContext`` at row-processing time.  This 
      includes straight population of attributes corresponding to rows,
      setting instance-level lazyloader callables on newly
      constructed instances, and appending child items to scalar/collection 
      attributes in response to eagerly-loaded relations.
