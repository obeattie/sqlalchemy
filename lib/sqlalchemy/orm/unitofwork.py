"""The internals for the Unit Of Work system.

Includes hooks into the attributes package enabling the routing of
change events to Unit Of Work objects, as well as the flush()
mechanism which creates a dependency structure that executes change
operations.

A Unit of Work is essentially a system of maintaining a graph of
in-memory objects and their modified state.  Objects are maintained as
unique against their primary key identity using an *identity map*
pattern.  The Unit of Work then maintains lists of objects that are
new, dirty, or deleted and provides the capability to flush all those
changes at once.
