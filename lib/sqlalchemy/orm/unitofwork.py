"""The internals for the Unit Of Work system.

Includes hooks into the attributes package enabling the routing of
change events to Unit Of Work objects, as well as the flush()
mechanism which creates a dependency structure that executes change
operations.

A Unit of Work is essentially a system of maintaining a graph of
in-memory objects and their modified state.  Objects are maintained as
unique against their primary key identity using an *identity map*
pattern.  The Unit of Work then maintains lists of objects that are
new, dirty, or deleted and provides the capability to flush all those
changes at once.

        'isdelete' when True indicates the operation will be a "delete" 
        operation (i.e. DELETE), otherwise is a "save" operation (i.e. INSERT/UPDATE).
        a ``UOWTaskElement`` marked as "save" which receives the "isdelete" flag will 
        be marked as deleted, but the reverse operation does not apply (i.e. goes from
        "delete" to being "not delete").

        `listonly` indicates that the object does not require a delete
        or save operation, but does require dependency operations to be 
        executed.  For example, adding a child object to a parent via a
        one-to-many relationship requires that a ``OneToManyDP`` object
        corresponding to the parent's mapper synchronize the instance's primary key
        value into the foreign key attribute of the child object, even though 
        no changes need be persisted on the parent.
        
        a listonly object may be "upgraded" to require a save/delete operation
        by a subsequent append() of the same object instance with the `listonly`
        flag set to False.  once the flag is set to false, it stays that way
        on the ``UOWTaskElement``.
        
        `childtask` is an optional ``UOWTask`` element represending operations which
        are dependent on the parent ``UOWTaskElement``.  This flag is only used on 
        `UOWTask` objects created within the "cyclical sort" part of the hierarchical
        sort, which generates a dependency tree of individual instances instead of 
        mappers when cycles between mappers are detected.
