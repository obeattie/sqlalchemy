    The returned object is a subclass of ``Session``, which, when instantiated with no
    arguments, uses the
    keyword arguments configured here as its constructor arguments.  It is intended
    that the `sessionmaker()` function be called within the global scope of an application,
    and the returned class be made available to the rest of the application as the 
    single class used to instantiate sessions.
    
    e.g.::
    
        # global scope
        Session = sessionmaker(autoflush=False)
        
        # later, in a local scope, create and use a session:
        sess = Session()
    
    Any keyword arguments sent to the constructor itself will override the "configured"
    keywords::
    
        Session = sessionmaker()
        
        # bind an individual session to a connection
        sess = Session(bind=connection)
        
    The class also includes a special classmethod ``configure()``, which allows 
    additional configurational options to take place after the custom ``Session``
    class has been generated.  This is useful particularly for defining the 
    specific ``Engine`` (or engines) to which new instances of ``Session``
    should be bound::
    
        Session = sessionmaker()
        Session.configure(bind=create_engine('sqlite:///foo.db'))
        
        sess = Session()
    
    The function features a single keyword argument of its own, `class_`, which
    may be used to specify an alternate class other than ``sqlalchemy.orm.session.Session``
    which should be used by the returned class.  All other keyword arguments sent to 
    `sessionmaker()` are passed through to the instantiated `Session()` object.

class Session(object):
    """Encapsulates a set of objects being operated upon within an object-relational operation.

    The Session is the front end to SQLAlchemy's **Unit of Work** implementation. The concept
    behind Unit of Work is to track modifications to a field of objects, and then be able to
    flush those changes to the database in a single operation.
    
    SQLAlchemy's unit of work includes these functions:

    * The ability to track in-memory changes on scalar- and collection-based object
      attributes, such that database persistence operations can be assembled based on those
      changes.

    * The ability to organize individual SQL queries and population of newly generated
      primary and foreign key-holding attributes during a persist operation such that
      referential integrity is maintained at all times.

    * The ability to maintain insert ordering against the order in which new instances were
      added to the session.

    * an Identity Map, which is a dictionary keying instances to their unique primary key
      identity. This ensures that only one copy of a particular entity is ever present
      within the session, even if repeated load operations for the same entity occur. This
      allows many parts of an application to get a handle to a particular object without
      any chance of modifications going to two different places.

    When dealing with instances of mapped classes, an instance may be *attached* to a
    particular Session, else it is *unattached* . An instance also may or may not correspond
    to an actual row in the database. These conditions break up into four distinct states:

    * *Transient* - an instance that's not in a session, and is not saved to the database;
      i.e. it has no database identity. The only relationship such an object has to the ORM
      is that its class has a `mapper()` associated with it.

    * *Pending* - when you `save()` a transient instance, it becomes pending. It still
      wasn't actually flushed to the database yet, but it will be when the next flush
      occurs.

    * *Persistent* - An instance which is present in the session and has a record in the
      database. You get persistent instances by either flushing so that the pending
      instances become persistent, or by querying the database for existing instances (or
      moving persistent instances from other sessions into your local session).

    * *Detached* - an instance which has a record in the database, but is not in any
      session. Theres nothing wrong with this, and you can use objects normally when
      they're detached, **except** they will not be able to issue any SQL in order to load
      collections or attributes which are not yet loaded, or were marked as "expired".

    The session methods which control instance state include ``save()``, ``update()``,
    ``save_or_update()``, ``delete()``, ``merge()``, and ``expunge()``.
    
    The Session object is **not** threadsafe, particularly during flush operations.  A session
    which is only read from (i.e. is never flushed) can be used by concurrent threads if it's
    acceptable that some object instances may be loaded twice.  
    
    The typical pattern to managing Sessions in a multi-threaded environment is either to use
    mutexes to limit concurrent access to one thread at a time, or more commonly to establish
    a unique session for every thread, using a threadlocal variable.  SQLAlchemy provides 
    a thread-managed Session adapter, provided by the [sqlalchemy.orm#scoped_session()] function.

        """Construct a new Session.

            autoflush
                when ``True``, all query operations will issue a ``flush()`` call to this
                ``Session`` before proceeding. This is a convenience feature so that
                ``flush()`` need not be called repeatedly in order for database queries to
                retrieve results. It's typical that ``autoflush`` is used in conjunction with
                ``transactional=True``, so that ``flush()`` is never called; you just call
                ``commit()`` when changes are complete to finalize all changes to the
                database.
        
            bind
                an optional ``Engine`` or ``Connection`` to which this ``Session`` should be
                bound. When specified, all SQL operations performed by this session will
                execute via this connectable.
                
            binds
                an optional dictionary, which contains more granular "bind" information than
                the ``bind`` parameter provides. This dictionary can map individual ``Table``
                instances as well as ``Mapper`` instances to individual ``Engine`` or
                ``Connection`` objects. Operations which proceed relative to a particular
                ``Mapper`` will consult this dictionary for the direct ``Mapper`` instance as
                well as the mapper's ``mapped_table`` attribute in order to locate an
                connectable to use. The full resolution is described in the ``get_bind()``
                method of ``Session``. Usage looks like::
                
                    sess = Session(binds={
                        SomeMappedClass : create_engine('postgres://engine1'),
                        somemapper : create_engine('postgres://engine2'),
                        some_table : create_engine('postgres://engine3'),
                    })
                    
                Also see the ``bind_mapper()`` and ``bind_table()`` methods.
            
            echo_uow
                When ``True``, configure Python logging to dump all unit-of-work
                transactions. This is the equivalent of
                ``logging.getLogger('sqlalchemy.orm.unitofwork').setLevel(logging.DEBUG)``.
            
            extension
                an optional [sqlalchemy.orm.session#SessionExtension] instance, which will receive
                pre- and post- commit and flush events, as well as a post-rollback event.  User-
                defined code may be placed within these hooks using a user-defined subclass
                of ``SessionExtension``.
                
            transactional
                Set up this ``Session`` to automatically begin transactions. Setting this
                flag to ``True`` is the rough equivalent of calling ``begin()`` after each
                ``commit()`` operation, after each ``rollback()``, and after each
                ``close()``. Basically, this has the effect that all session operations are
                performed within the context of a transaction. Note that the ``begin()``
                operation does not immediately utilize any connection resources; only when
                connection resources are first required do they get allocated into a
                transactional context.

            twophase
                when ``True``, all transactions will be started using
                [sqlalchemy.engine_TwoPhaseTransaction]. During a ``commit()``, after
                ``flush()`` has been issued for all attached databaes, the ``prepare()``
                method on each database's ``TwoPhaseTransaction`` will be called. This allows
                each database to roll back the entire transaction, before each transaction is
                committed.

            weak_identity_map
                When set to the default value of ``False``, a weak-referencing map is used;
                instances which are not externally referenced will be garbage collected
                immediately. For dereferenced instances which have pending changes present,
                the attribute management system will create a temporary strong-reference to
                the object which lasts until the changes are flushed to the database, at which
                point it's again dereferenced. Alternatively, when using the value ``True``,
                the identity map uses a regular Python dictionary to store instances. The
                session will maintain all instances present until they are removed using
                expunge(), clear(), or purge().
