"""topological sorting algorithms.  the key to the unit of work is to assemble a list
of dependencies amongst all the different mappers that have been defined for classes.
Related tables with foreign key constraints have a definite insert order, deletion order, 
objects need dependent properties from parent objects set up before saved, etc.  
These are all encoded as dependencies, in the form "mapper X is dependent on mapper Y", 
meaning mapper Y's objects must be saved before those of mapper X, and mapper X's objects 
must be deleted before those of mapper Y.

The topological sort is an algorithm that receives this list of dependencies as a "partial
ordering", that is a list of pairs which might say, "X is dependent on Y", "Q is dependent
on Z", but does not necessarily tell you anything about Q being dependent on X. Therefore,
its not a straight sort where every element can be compared to another...only some of the
elements have any sorting preference, and then only towards just some of the other elements.
For a particular partial ordering, there can be many possible sorts that satisfy the
conditions.

An intrinsic "gotcha" to this algorithm is that since there are many possible outcomes
to sorting a partial ordering, the algorithm can return any number of different results for the
same input; just running it on a different machine architecture, or just random differences
in the ordering of dictionaries, can change the result that is returned.  While this result
is guaranteed to be true to the incoming partial ordering, if the partial ordering itself
does not properly represent the dependencies, code that works fine will suddenly break, then
work again, then break, etc.   Most of the bugs I've chased down while developing the "unit of work"
have been of this nature - very tricky to reproduce and track down, particularly before I 
realized this characteristic of the algorithm.
